<!--Copyright (c) 2003,2012 Hewlett-Packard Development Company, L.P.-->

<!-- Description: This is a sample XML script to set the default     -->
<!--              Administrator account password using HPONCFG.EXE.  -->

<!-- NOTE:  You will need to replace the USER_LOGIN and PASSWORD     -->
<!--        and other values inside the quotation marks with values  -->
<!--        that are appropriate for your environment.               -->

<!--        Use this script with HPONCFG to install a known password -->
<!--        for the Administrator account.  HPONCFG requires that you-->
<!--        log into Windows or Linux with administrator or root     -->
<!--        credentials.                                             -->

<!--        Note that this assumes that there is an Administrator    -->
<!--        account because it is not intended to create one.  The   -->
<!--        LOGIN credentials are ignored when used with HPONCFG.    -->

<!--        After this script has been used successfully with HPONCFG-->
<!--        you may login using the credentials: "Administrator" and -->
<!--        "password".                                              -->

<!--        Use CPQLOCFG.EXE ver 4.00 or greater with this script.   -->

<!--        This script was written for iLO 4 firmware version 1.01  -->
<!--        release.                                                 -->

<!--        See "HP Integrated Lights-Out Management Processor       -->
