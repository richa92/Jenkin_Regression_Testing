<!-- Description:  This is a sample XML script to set certificate    -->
<!--               signing request settings to default subject info. -->
<!--               These CSR settings will be employed the next time -->
<!--               when iLO generates a new CSR.	               -->

<!-- NOTE:  You will need to replace the USER_LOGIN and PASSWORD     -->
<!--        values with values that are appropriate for your         -->
<!--        environment.                                             -->

<!--        Use CPQLOCFG.EXE ver 3.20 or greater with this script.   -->

<!--        This script was written for iLO 2 firmware version 2.06  -->
<!--        release.                                                 -->

<!--      When set to No, it enables using of Default CSR values.    -->

<!--      When set to Yes, private key of 2048 bit will be used, and -->
<!--      when set to NO, a 1024 bit key is used.                    -->
<!--      If this tag is absent from the script, the current setting -->
<!--      will be used.                                              -->
<!-- NOTE: When the 2048 bit private key is enabled, iLO 2 might take-->
