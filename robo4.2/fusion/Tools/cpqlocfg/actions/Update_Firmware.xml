<!--               firmware of following devices:                    -->
<!--                 Integrated Lights-Out 4 (iLO 4)                 -->

<!--        this script is updating the firmware.                    -->
<!--        The Lights-Out device will automatically reset itself to -->
<!--        have the new firmware take effect at the end of the      -->
