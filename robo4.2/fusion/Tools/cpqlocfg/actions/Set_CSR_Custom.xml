<!-- Description:  This is a sample XML script to set Certificate    -->
<!--               Signing Request(CSR) with custom subject info.    -->
<!--               These CSR settings will be employed the next time -->
<!--               when iLO generates a new CSR.                     -->
<!-- NOTE:  You will need to replace the USER_LOGIN and PASSWORD     -->
<!--        values with values that are appropriate for your         -->
<!--        environment.                                             -->
<!--        Use CPQLOCFG.EXE ver 3.20 or greater with this script.   -->
<!--        This script was written for iLO 2 firmware version 2.06  -->
<!--        release.                                                 -->
