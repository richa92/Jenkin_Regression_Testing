<!--   Description: This is a sample RIBCL script to retrieve the    -->
<!--                host data displayed on the Server Information    -->
<!--                page.                                            -->

<!--                The data is extracted from SMBIOS records stored -->
<!--                on the host.  The raw data in the SMBIOS records -->
<!--                is retrieved using this script.  You can access  -->
<!--                the data by base 64 decoding the returned data,  -->
<!--                although these details are beyond the scope of   -->
<!--                these notes.  The same fields that are displayed -->
<!--                on the web page are also decoded through this    -->
<!--                interface.                                       -->

<!-- NOTE:  You will need to replace the USER_LOGIN and PASSWORD     -->
<!--        values with values that are appropriate for your         -->
<!--        environment.                                             -->
