Generate data from OV and deploy new OV using the same data captured.

Copy-OV-Config-And-Deploy:
    This Test suite is written to capture the data(all the resources) configured in OneView and to deploy a new
    OneView with the same captured data. This Test Suite has below 3 sub-test suites ,which are listed below

        1) 01_generate_variable_file.txt
            This is the test suite to capture the data from configured OneView.

        2) 02_configure_onview.txt
            This is the test suite to deploy OneView using captured data

        3) 03_copy_ov_config_and_deploy.txt
            This is a single test suite which can be used to capture data and deploy OneView

Resources:
    config-files:
        Configuration files for each resources that are added to OneView is placed in this folder
        Each individual config file defines data attributes which are captured for that resource

    data_variables.py:
        It has the details Of OneView credentials and few other resources which need password authentication to add to OneView.

    keyword.txt:
        Contains Keywords required during deploying OneView with the captured data.

    resource.txt:
        Contains common file paths and common keywords used across this tool.

    rist_util.py:
        This script takes GET Response Data of resource as input and generates data file in required format,so that the tool can utilize it to deploy OneView

    sample_data.py:
        This is just a sample data file generated/captured by script when "01_generate_variable_file.txt" is executed
        This data file is used to configure and deploy captured data to new OneView appliance

Resources covered in this tool:
    timeandlocale, licenses, appliance, users, san_managers, ethnets, fcnets, fcoenets, networkset, storagesystems, storagepools, storagevolumetemplates,
    storagevolumes, saslig, lig, encgrp, logicalenclosures, spt, server_profiles_from_spt, profiles, profiles_with_storage, encs, servers

    Resources which need authentication like SAN manager, Storage are handled in data_variables.py

Requirements and specifications need to be done by tester before Tool Execution:
    1. Before Capturing data from Oneview, Add Credential details in data_variables.py for below resources
       a. SAN MAnagers
       b. Users
       c. Storage Credentials
       d. OA Credentials ( In case of C7000 appliance)
    2. Update ${BUILD_TYPE} variable in resource.txt.(C7000 in case of C7000 build and Tbird in case of Tbird Build)
    3. After capturing data using tool,captured datafile should be updated with "SAN Manager Password" and Enclosure OA details(Incase of C7000)
       before deploying it another Oneview.

How To Run:
    Please refer Test suites 01_generate_variable_file.txt, 02_configure_onview.txt or 03_copy_ov_config_and_deploy.txt
    to know how to run these tests.

    1. To Capture data from Oneview, 01_generate_variable_file.txt is Executed.Run the following command in command prompt.
       a. Navigate to path "Copy-OV-Config-And-Deploy" folder
       b. Run command :- pybot -d ../logs -vRESOURCELIST:"timeandlocale licenses appliance users san_managers ethernet_networks fc_networks fcoenets networksets storage_systems_with_pools storage_pools_toedit storage_volume_templates storage_volumes sas_lig ligs encgroups_add logical_enclosure server_profile_templates server_profiles_from_spt server_profiles server_profile_with_storage enclosures servers" -vVARIABLE_FILENAME:../resources/OVdot158.py -vSRC_OVIP:15.186.21.246 -tTC1* 01_generate_variable_file.txt
       c. Above command will generate python file  called "OVdot158.py" under resource folder. It contains data for above specfied resources configured in Oneview
       d. Variables used in above command :
             logs - logfile are placed in this folder
             -vRESOURCELIST - Specify resource name for data generation. each resource should be separated by single space.
             vVARIABLE_FILENAME - Specify the output data file name to which data is captured
             -vSRC_OVIP - Specify Oneview Appliance IP

    2. To Deploy Captured Data on Oneview, "02_configure_onview.txt" is executed. Run the following command in command prompt.
       a. Navigate to path "Copy-OV-Config-And-Deploy" folder
       b. pybot -d ../logs -vRESOURCELIST:"licenses appliance users san_managers ethernet_networks fc_networks fcoenets networksets storage_systems_with_pools storage_pools_toedit storage_volume_templates storage_volumes sas_lig ligs encgroups_add logical_enclosure server_profile_templates server_profiles_from_spt server_profiles server_profile_with_storage enclosures servers" -vVARIABLE_FILENAME:../resources/OVdot158.py -vDEST_OVIP:15.186.21.246 -tTC2* 02_configure_onview.txt
       c. Above command deploys and configure data("OVdot158.py") to oneview
       d. Variables used in above command :
             All variables are same except -vDEST_OVIP which is used to specify Onview appliance IP on which Data is deployed
             vVARIABLE_FILENAME - Specify the generated Data file name.

    3. To perform above two actions simultaniously, 03_copy_ov_config_and_deploy.txt is executed.
       a  Navigate to path "Copy-OV-Config-And-Deploy" folder
       b. pybot -vVARIABLE_FILENAME:../resources/OVdot158.py -vSRC_OVIP:15.186.21.246 -vDEST_OVIP:15.186.21.158 -vTRANSFER_ENCLOSURE:True -tTC3* 03_copy_ov_config_and_deploy.txt
