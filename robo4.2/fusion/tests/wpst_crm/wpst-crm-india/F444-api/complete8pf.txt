*** Test Cases *** 
					
00 Create LIG, EG and issue the rest call before importing the enclosure and verify that it returns number of PFs as 8	
	
	Fusion Api Login Appliance 		${APPLIANCE_IP}		${admin_credentials}

    ${ligs} =     Copy List     ${ligs}

	Log to console and logfile	Successfully verified the downlink ports of supershaw as 4pfs
	sleep	3s

06 Firmware version is less than 4.5,so PFs are 4.NIC has capability of 8PF.Ports from 1a to 1d only should be in server
	#Create server profile,for port 1e to 1h should throw an error as corresponding interconnect doesnot have 8 PF 	

	Fusion Api Login Appliance	${APPLIANCE_IP}		${admin_credentials}

   	${profiles} =	Copy List	${newports_profiles}
   	Edit Server Profiles from variable	${profiles}
   	Log to console and logfile	Successfully verified error message	
   
07 Perform the firmware update to 4.5 to the Logical interconnect and issue the rest call to verify if it returns number of PFs as 8 now for the supershaw.	

	Fusion Api Login Appliance          ${APPLIANCE_IP}         ${admin_credentials}

08 Interconnects are running with firmware version 4.5 and now profile with higher order PF
	#now if we assign from ports 1e to 1h should not throw any error. Creation of server profile should succeed.

09 Replace the Mezz card with adapter of 10GB capacity(which doesnt support 8PF) and perform the GET of /rest/server-profiles and 
 	#verify it lists ports only from 1-a to 1-d.
 	
 	Fusion Api Login Appliance          ${APPLIANCE_IP}         ${admin_credentials}
 	Remove All Server Profiles
 	#Add Server Profile for 1a to 1d
	${profiles} =	Copy List	${mezz_profiles}
   	Add Server Profiles from variable	${profiles}
    ${resp} =	Get Profile Lists
    Log to Console	${resp}
    Run Keyword If	${resp} == ${mezz_downlink}		Log to Console	Successfully verified the port Lists	Else	Fail	
    Log to Console	Successfully verified the port Lists
	
	    
10 Editing the server profile with 1-e to 1-h or 2-e to 2-h on non 8PF supported card
    #create server profile and assign a connection to any of the port from 1-a to 1-d 
	#or 2-a to 2-d and apply the server profile. Now try to edit the connection using the PUT call of  
	#/rest/server-profiles and try to assign to the ports of range 1-e to 1-h ot 2-e to 2-h. 
	#This operation should throw an error since 8PF supported card is not present in the server. Verify the same.

    #Edit Server Profile for ports 1e to 1h
   	${profiles} =	Copy List	${mezz_profiles2}
   	${resp} =	Edit Server Profiles from variable	${profiles}
   	Log to Console	Successfully verified the error message

11 Remove the enclosure and now edit the LIG with other VC module and now issue the rest call
	#before importing the enclosure  to verify that it does not show up 8PF.
	Remove All Server Profiles
	Remove All Enclosures
	Log to console and logfile	Successfully Removed enclosure
	${ligs1} =	Copy Dictionary		${ligs1}	
	Log to console and logfile	${ligs1}
	Edit LIG	${ligs1['lig1']}
	Log to console and logfile	Successfully Edited the Profile
	
	#Before importing for Other interconnects
	${li_downlink4} =	Copy Dictionary		${li_downlink[1]}
	Get Logical Downlink from variable	${li_downlink4}
	Log to console and logfile	Successfully verified the downlink ports as 4pfs
    sleep	20s
    
12 Now edit the LIG back to the original configurations having 2 supershaw and import the enclosure back.
	#Issue the rest call now to verify if it shows up 8PF correctly.

	${ligs1} =	Copy Dictionary		${ligs1}	
	Log to console and logfile	${ligs1}
	Edit LIG	${ligs1['lig2']}
	Log to console and logfile	Successfully Edited the LIG
	
	${encs1} =	Copy List	${encs1}
	Add Enclosures from variable    ${encs1}
    Log to console and logfile	ENCLOSURE created sucessfully
    
    #After importing for Supershaw
	${li_downlink3} =	Copy Dictionary		${li_downlink[0]}
	Get Logical Downlink from variable	${li_downlink3}
	Log to console and logfile	Successfully verified the downlink ports as 8pfs
