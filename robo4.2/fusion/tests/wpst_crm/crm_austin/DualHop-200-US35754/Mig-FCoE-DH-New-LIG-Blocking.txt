...               Command Line Example:
...					>pybot -t TestXXX* Mig-FCoE-DH-New-LIG-Blocking.txt
...               Output: There are two files generated in the dataFiles directory,
...					"data-rpt-F100-Migration-FCoE-Dual-Hop-TestXXX.json" contains the VC to OV compatibility report.
...					"data-ov-F100-Migration-FCoE-Dual-Hop-TestXXX.json" contains VC to OV migration information.
...					There are three files generated in the local directory (tests) - output.html, log.html, and report.html

...                This test suite covers the following test cases in ALM:
...                  [1]Migration FCoE Dual Hop - Attempt to migrate an FCoE SUS that does not have any assigned up links - failure expected
...                  [1]Migration FCoE Dual Hop - Attempt to migrate when the sum of all FCoE networks is greater than 32  - failure expected
...                  Migration FCoE Dual Hop - Attempt to migrate a SUS containing 2 FCoE networks whose names differ only due to capitalization - failure expected
...                  [1]Migration FCoE Dual Hop - Attempt to migrate an FCoE network where the VLAN is currently set to 1 - failure expected
...                  Migration FCoE Dual Hop - Attempt to migrate an FCoE SUS that does not have any assigned up links - failure expected
...                  Migration FCoE Dual Hop - Verify migration with VC module Super Shaw
...                  Migration FCoE Dual Hop - Attempt to migrate when the sum of all FCoE networks is greater than 32  - failure expected

*** Test Cases ***
Test100--Base Setup
	CleanOV.CleanVC
	Import VC

Test101--Verify that an FCoE SUS without uplinks fails to migrate
	Delete VC Config 
    Config VC   ${vc_config_file_Test101}
    Report.Write.Compare

Test102--Verify that 33 FCoE networks assigned to one ICM fails to migrate
	Delete VC Config
    Config VC    ${vc_config_file_Test102}
    Report.Write.Compare
    
Test103--Verify that two FCoE networks with the same name (except for capitalization) cannot migrate
	Delete VC Config 
    Config VC    ${vc_config_file_Test103}
    Report.Write.Compare

Test104--Verify that an FCoE network set to VLAN 1 cannot migrate
	Delete VC Config
