Documentation     VC Migration Compatibility Test Suite for Dual Hop Support
...               This part of test only verifies compatibility test therefore there's no requirement
...               for any OV configuration. 
...               Test Dual Hop Critical migration issues
...               Issue1: No uplink port is defined for FCoE network within an uplinkset.
...                       The migration manager should detect this and issue report generated.
...               Issue2: Define FCoE networks with same name but with  different capitalization. 
...                       The migration manager should detect this and issue report generated.
...               Issue3: Define an FCoE network with vlan ID with a value of 1.
...                       The migration manager should detect this and issue report generated.
...               Issue4: More than 32 FCoE networks is defined on VC.
...                       The migration manager should detect this and issue report generated.
