Documentation     1k Vlan Migration Manager Test Suite
...               Testing migration manager with following target configurations:
...               * Domain has a couple of profiles.
...               This test suite covers the following test cases:
...                [1]Domain with 4 to 5 profiles, 1000 networks in use
...                [1]Profile has 32 connections 162 per sus
...                [1]Profiles have 16 connections 162 per sus
...
...               NOTE: These tests will fail during post migration JSON compare due to FC mac using the one from OneView and/or Utah module max speed switching from - to + value.
...                     The former can be worked around by using conditional exception if we want it to pass but I rather have it fail and inspected instead of ignoring.
...                     The latter is a known issue: QXCR1001420557: [MIG_MGR] FC ports show different speeds on Utah
