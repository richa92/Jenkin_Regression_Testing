Steps to accomplish this:
1.	Identify rigs available for buildup*
2.	Identify manual testers who can build up the rig through profile creation. This should likely happen against a 4.00 build to start
3.	Identify automation engineers who are responsible for capturing data
4.	Solution tester builds up the rig and hands off to the automation engineer
5.	Automation engineer captures the data file and makes modification necessary to use in a build up script
6.	Solution tester and automation engineer coordinate to provide automation engineer access to the HW to test out the script
7.	Data file is made available for testing through a Jenkins job
