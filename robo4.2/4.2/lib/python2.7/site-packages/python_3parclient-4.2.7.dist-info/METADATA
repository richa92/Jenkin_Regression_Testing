HPE 3PAR REST Client
====================
This is a Client library that can talk to the HPE 3PAR Storage array.  The 3PAR
storage array has a REST web service interface and a command line interface.
This client library implements a simple interface for talking with either
interface, as needed.  The python Requests library is used to communicate
with the REST interface.  The python paramiko library is used to communicate
with the command line interface over an SSH connection.

This is the new location for the rebranded HP 3PAR Rest Client and will be
where all future releases are made. It was previously located on PyPi at:
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/hp3parclient

The GitHub repository for the old HP 3PAR Rest Client is located at:
https://github.com/hpe-storage/python-3parclient/tree/3.x

The HP 3PAR Rest Client (hp3parclient) is now considered deprecated.

To run all unit tests with code coverage::

 $ tox -e cover

The output of the coverage tests will be placed into the ``coverage`` dir.


Folders
=======

* docs -- contains the documentation.
* hpe3parclient -- the actual client.py library
* test -- unit tests
* samples -- some sample uses

Documentation
=============

To build the documentation::

 $ tox -e docs

To view the built documentation point your browser to::

 docs/html/index.html


Running Simulators
==================

The unit tests should automatically start/stop the simulators.  To start them
manually use the following commands.  To stop them, use 'kill'.  Starting them
manually before running unit tests also allows you to watch the debug output.

* WSAPI::

  $ python test/HPE3ParMockServer_flask.py -port 5001 -user <USERNAME> -password <PASSWORD> -debug

* SSH::

  $ python test/HPE3ParMockServer_ssh.py [port]
